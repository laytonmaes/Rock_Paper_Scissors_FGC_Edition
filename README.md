## Introduction
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissor gauntlet! in this project, I built a game based off of the
general format of Rock Paper Scissors. When the user enters the page, they are greeted with
the first choice, whether to choose to play a game built on the classic 3 choice game,
or whether to play the turbo edition, adding two more options. it then throws them into the
selected game mode, where they will fight up to 9 times until one or both players are KO'ed.
they also have the ability to activate a super to turn the tide of battle!

This project was assigned as a part of Turing School of Software and Design's Front-End program, students had one week to complete it.

## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS
    - Flexbox
  - Clip Studio Paint
    - Used to create all the icons on the page.

## Features
- When a user initially opens the page, they will be met with a choice between the classic
rock paper scissors and a complex version. the decision is accompanied by custom graphics indicating
the rules of both modes.
- When a game mode is selected, the site takes you to a page where you will fight the CPU enemy.
- on the side there are custom graphics that the user can select to indicate what weapon
the player selects. these include Dragon Punch, Tornado Kick, and Fire Ball, and if the Turbo Edition
is selected, they can also choose between Heavy Punch and Heavy Kick.
-  When the attack button is selected, the game evaluates who won and who lost and damages the loser,
taking one of the 5 health bar segments away. If both players select the same option, both take damage.
- When below 40% health, the player chan choose to execute a super, doubling their damage on a win,
and winning trades automatically.
- When a players health bar drops below 0, the game pulls up a KO screen, showing the results of the round and asking the player whether they want to continue, restarting the round and keeping the round
tally, or whether they want to go back to option select and refresh the page.


## Possible Future Extensions
- adding sound effects and small animations to accentuate user experience.
- re-design the page to allow for sprite animation and characters to be added.
- add music to enhance ambiance.
